#1. Import the random and time libraries.
import random
import time
#2. Print Hello World!
print("hello world")
#3. Create a class called Calendar that contains the following attributes: self, name, days, holidays, leapyear.
class Calendar:
    def __init__(self, name, days, holidays, leapyear):
        self.name = name
        self.days = days
        self.holidays = holidays
        self.leapyear = leapyear

#4. Create twelve months as objects listing the name as a string, the number of days as an int, any major holidays as a list (keep the list blank if there are none), and a boolean that says if it is affected on a leap year or not.

#5. Create a function inside the class that adds 1 to the number of days for any month affected on a leap year. Call the function to those months.

#6. Create a function inside the class that checks to see if there are any holidays inside of that month and prints their names if so. Call the function to a random month.

#7. Make a loop that checks to see if the month has an even number of days and adds it to a total.

#8. Create a list and put inside the months you DIDN'T add together #4.

#9. Create custom months with custom names, number of days, any major holidays, and if it is affected on a leap year.

#10. Make a loop that calculates the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.

#11. Use a lambda function to add the Fibonacci numbers together and add the sum to a random custom month.

#12. Print ("\u2764 \u0041 \u0050 \u0052 \u0049 \u004C \u0020 \u0046 \u004F \u004F \u004C \u0053 \u0021 \u2764") and ignore steps 1 through 11
print("\u2764 \u0041 \u0050 \u0052 \u0049 \u004C \u0020 \u0046 \u004F \u004F \u004C \u0053 \u0021 \u2764")
