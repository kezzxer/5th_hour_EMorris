#Scenario 2:
#The programmer in charge of the player character party stats is
#having some issues with their code. Despite rigorous testing,
#they are inexperienced and can't seem to figure out why the damage
#testing isn't working. Your team lead has asked you to help by fixing
#the party dictionary, insert an enemy into the code below, and
#testing to see if a player character can damage the with a printed
#test that shows the enemy health has changed.
